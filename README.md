# Coursera_Learning_Notes
Compiles my personal learning journey on Coursera. Opinions are of my own and does not represent my current company. 

- Trivia
1. Avoid copying concepts that is already in the course note sheets. 
2. Believing everything in books is worse than having no books at all.
3. I do try to make a copy of the learning goals from each module before the lesson starts. 
4. I do keep notes of things I found interesting. They could be a paragraph of dictation from the professor, a side notation 
of things I checked from the Internet, a dumped gists of my own thoughts. Things like that. 
5. Opinions are of my own.
