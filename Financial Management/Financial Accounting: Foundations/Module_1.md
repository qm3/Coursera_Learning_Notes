# Notes:
1. Goals
- Understand what accounting information is
- Identify various users of accounting information and the type of information they need
- Identify main financial statements, type of information each provides, and how they are related to each other. 

2. Notes
- Goals are always necessary to keep in mind before jumping in... I guess. Anyway I should jump back to https://www.coursera.org/learn/financial-accounting-basics/supplement/mVNCq/module-1-overview after done. 
- I have the urge to download all the lecture slides and notes, of which I will never go back to. 
- Coursera has the urge to ensure property security by adding  prefixes to all downloaded lectures slides and notes, of which they will never admit to.
